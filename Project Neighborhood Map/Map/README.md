For this project I have interacted with various API services to create a map marker with interesting places. I used Google Maps API and FOurthSquare API to create this application with knockout framework.


How to run application:
1. click on index.htmlor or you can visit my GitHub page (https://github.com/AnjaliPa/Front-End-Web-Developer-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%20Neighborhood%20Map).
2. When you load it it will display five static location in list as well as location marker on googlemap.
3. click on those locations markers will be bounced as well as click on list.
4. All information in info window will come with dynamically.
5. you can search the location like if u serach santa clara then santaclara will be still available in list and map as well.



Used Technology:
